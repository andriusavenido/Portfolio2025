I worked closely with backend developers and service managers to conduct software testing for new releases and partook in identifying, tracking, and resolving bugs/software issues. I also performed various hardware and software testing for CBSA biometric stations. Documented software releases, including writing release notes and updating/maintaining current documentation. On behalf of my team, I provided technical support and direction to clients within CBSA and IRCC. Additionally, I helped service managers in managing and contributing to agency-wide technical projects. Overall at CBSA, I gained valuable technical skills and knowledge about IT systems and government processes. I currently have valid Reliability Clearance.",
